Miquel Simonet is a laboratory phonologist, phonetician, and scholar of second language acquisition. Laboratory phonologists employ the auxiliary theories and methods of instrumental phonetics and experimental psycholinguistics to investigate phonological competence. Miquel's primary area of expertise concerns second language speech learning, particularly the acquisition of the sounds and (the phonological structure of) words of a second language. A second area of interest of his is phonetic and phonological variation and change, including contact-induced change, with a focus on Western Romance. Miquel's publications have appeared in journals such as the *Journal of Phonetics*, the *Journal of the International Phonetic Association*, *Language and Speech*, *Second Language Research*, the *International Journal of Bilingualism*, *Phonetica*, *Laboratory Phonology*, *Linguistics*, *Probus*, *Linguistic Approaches to Bilingualism*, *Languages*, *Hispania*, and *Studies in Hispanic and Lusophone Linguistics*.
